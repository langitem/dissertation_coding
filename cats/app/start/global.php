Instead of displaying a detailed error message to your visitors, you can catch the

missing method for your application inside app/start/global.php:

Here we are not merely returning a string, but a Response object with the message
as its first parameter and an HTTP status code as the second parameter. In the
first two routes that we wrote, Laravel automatically converted the string that
we returned into a 200 OK HTTP response (for example, in the first route it is:
Response::make("All cats", 200)). While the difference might not be obvious
to the end users, the distinction between "404 Not Found" and "200 OK" is important
for the search engines that crawl your site or when you are writing an API.
